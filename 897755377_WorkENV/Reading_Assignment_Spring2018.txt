Reading assignment 
1. Who started the GNU project? Linus Torvals was the creater of Linux, but
the GNU project originally began in 184 by Richard Stallman.
2. What is GNUs basic tenet and how is it different from proprietary commercial products? Richard stallman believed that knowledge
	that constitutes a running program (source code) should be free. The basic tenet is that the souce code is fundamental to 
	the furthering of computer science and freely available source code is is truly necessary for the inovation to continue.  
3. What is GPL and what is its basic goal ? The GPL is the GNU General Public License. It was created to protect free software from 
	being sold for profit, and to expand the information taken from the source code without restricting others to do the same.
	It also allowed for progress innovation of new software and that software itself would be protected under the GPL.
4. Who invented Graphical User Interface ? Xerox PARC, an Industry driven
	company invented the GUI as well as the ethernet mouse. 
5. How does Open Source business operate ? Open Source business operates by
	allowing anyone to use and distribute the code freely, thus making it easier
	to create a Linux system. By doing so, the distributor can charge for
	services for their distribution. 
6. Describe open source business model ? An example would be that that of Red
Hat Linux. Packaging its full distribution with a nice manual. The reading uses the word brand
	marketing to primarily sell convenience, because no one really wants
	to download all the pieces that make up a full-featured Linux system. It
	allows companies to charge for the distribution, but what makes some companies
	better is that they support the development of new software and redistribute
	it back into the community at large as Open source. An old-fashioned model was
	to supply support for the distributions they were offering. 
7. What is BIND ? What is its common name ? BIND or Berkley Internet Network Domain is a program used to create a
practical monopoly. The program is able to convert addressess in the form of a URL into their actual IP address. 
8. What is the advantage of open source development model ? One advantage of Open Source is the ability to look at 
	it as a business opportunity for such companies like IBM, and Oracle because of the ability to innovate. Like, science
	Open Source rests on a process of discovery and justification. In order to justify that something is valid, it must be
	replicated. Similarly, in order to replicate the workings of source  code, it must be shared for testing on different systems
	and compilers. 
9. What makes the best innovators ? The best innovators are those that learn from their mistakes, but the flourishing creativity that 
	leads to creativity comes at a cost. 
10. According to the reading material, what is the first open source example ? The first open source example according to the reading 
	 
11. The author described that there is another science that follows the methodology of open source, what is this science and why ? The 
	science of biology follows the science of open source. It is because in order to have proof that something works it must be tested
	by others for validity. It must be redistributed as a form of knowledge to build upon.  
12. What is a Hacker according to the author and where did the terminology come from ? The hacker which can be dated back to 1961 became 
	the term for MIT's Tech Model Railroad club. The TMRC's hackers became the nucleas of MIT's AI Laboratory. They were a group of 
	people from the Signals and Power Committe and then became a group of computer scientists from multiple Universities working on 
	the PDP-10.  
13. Who invented Unix ? A hacker from Bell Labs named Ken Thompson invented Unix in 1969.  
14. Who invented C? Another hacker named Dennis Richie invented C. 
15. What is KISS? According to the reading, it means "Keep It Simple, Stupid" and it is a philosphy that was used to create Unix and C. 
16. Which government agency participated the research of computer network ? The Department of Defense was a contributor to the research of
	computer nextwork.
17. What is the lawsuit between BSDI and AT&T about ? What is the outcome of it ? It was a lawsuit that alleged that the University of
	 Caliornia Berkley violated Unix System Laborities software license by distributing it, and copyright on UNIX. Code had been realeased
	that was based on the UNIX system, and thus BSDi knowing this violated the terms. USL felt threatened and came back with a lawsuit.
	The outcome was that many people were hessitant to use the software because of the lawsuit. During that time the publicity behind it 
	allowed Linux to gain an edge over everyone else. 
18. What is the definition of free software according to the author ? The ability to port and use a program from someone else, see the source code 
	so that you could read it, or change parts of it to to make a new program is what the author called free software. 
19. What is the definition of CopyLeft? It is a term used to prevent GNU software from becoming proprietary softare, or a means of keeping it free.
20. What is the future challenges of Free Software ?  
21. What is the difference between Unix and Linux ? Unix is a mostly C based portable, pleasant, unconstraining and flexible software environment
	while Linux full-featured Unix using the Free Software Foundation toolkit with entirely free and redistributable sources.  
22. What is the definition of open source for Derived Works ? It means that in order to repair or modify a program the source code needs to be 
	destributed with the initial work as well as any code that has been created using the initial source code.
23. What is the definition of Public Domain? A public domanin is a program that can be considered your own. You can take it as do as you please 
	with it. You can remove any information and modify it as you may without having to consent to any license. 
24. What does the term Free the lizard referred to ? Mozilla was the mascot for the now disbanded Netscape Communication Corporation. Freeing the 
	lizard refers to the releaes of the souce code by the members of Mozilla.org.
25. What happen on April Fools Day, 1998? The release of Mozilla. The Mozila Dot Party was planned and attended by the huge community of programmers. They gave
	away source code to many and had a live band.
