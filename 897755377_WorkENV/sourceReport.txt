For this report we were asked to use Reg Ex to search and subsitute 
text from a source file. I managed to accomplish this task by first
searching and running through the text that we were were asked to
replace. Using the "/" I was able to search for what were were asked
to look for.  This allowed me to really see what was going to be replaced
before I went ahead and replaced it. 
1. This is what I used for the first
one (:1,1499 s/<!--//g). By using the 1,1499 option, I am able to run 
throught the whole file. I didnt include anything between the 2 "/" 
because I was asked to remove and not replace. This is what i used for
the second part (1,1499 s/-->//g). Similar to the first part, but instead
was asked to search and substitue a different portion. 
2. This is what I used for the second one. :1,1499 s/ms-homepage-small.mp4/my_own_medium.mp4/g
This one is straight forward. I replaced the first part with the second part and used
the global option.  
3. For this option I went to the top of the page by using the 1G Enter 
Then I used this expression :s/feb30292ffc8/mar091317_1919/ I didn't search and 
replace through the whole file because you didn't state to change all instances. 

4. For this problem I used :1,1499/[^/,][A-Za-z0-9-]*.com/Web_site_place_holder/g
I ran through the whole file by using the range. I wanted to search and subtitute
all words that included all capital letters, 
lowercase letters, digits, dash, and period and ended with .com.
